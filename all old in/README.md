# What is Data Science

* Data Science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data.
* Using modern tools and techniques, helps find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions.
* The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and presented in various formats.

# The Data Science Lifecycle

## 1. Capture
Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction.

This stage involves gathering raw structured and unstructured data.

## 2. Maintain
Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture.
This stage covers taking the raw data and putting it in a form that can be used.

## 3. Process

Data Mining, Clustering/Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization. This phase involves understanding the hidden information.

## 4. Analyze

Exploratory/Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis. This stage involves performing the various analyses on the data.

## 5. Communicate

Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making. In this final step, analysis in easyly readable forms such as charts, graphs and reports.

# What is Artificial Intelligence

* Artificial Intelligence includes the simulation process of human intelligence by machine and special computer systems.
* The examples of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning and self-correction.
* Applications of AI include speech recognition, expert systems, and image recognition and machine vision.

# AI Programming focuses on three cognitive skills

## 1. Learning Process

This is for making the rules aka algorithm to learn the patterns or info form available data.

## 2. Reasoning Process

This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.

## 3. Self Correction Process

This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of AI

Advantages  | Disadvantages
------------- | -------------
Very good for data heavy jobs  | Infra dependent hence expensive
Saves time in computation | Requires technical expertise
Consistent results | Heavily dependent on data nothing beyond that

# Types of AI

There are 4 types of artificial intelligence

## 1. Reactive Machines

* Very basic, perceives things as it's given to it.
* A reactive machine canot store a memory and as a result cannot rely on past experiences to inform decision making in real-time.
* Perceiving the world directly means that reative machines are designed to complete only a limited number of specialized duties.
* Relable and has very specific usages.
* An Example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Only on runtime, mives not based on past moves.

## 2. Limited Memory

* More complex and can store previous data and predictions.
* Needs continuous training for updated patterns.
* Six steps must be followed:
    - Training data creation
    - Machine Learning model build up.
    - Predictions generation from ML model.
    - External feedback for predictions.
    - Storage of feedback
    - Repeat

## 3. Theory of Mind

Only conceptual. Should be able to grasp and process the concept of "mind". Research on going.

## 4. Self - Awareness

Only conceptual. Actions on top of Theory of Mind. Mimics human brain. Research on going.
